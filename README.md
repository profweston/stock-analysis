# VBA Challenge using Analysis of Stock Data

## Overview

This project analyzes data for 12 stocks related to Green Energy Companies to calculate their returns during the years 2017 and 2018. A VBA script utilizing nested loops was developed to find total volume and starting and ending price for each stock to produce a percent of return. Next the same analysis was done after refactoring the VBA code to remove the nested loop design and implement an index design. A summary of the stocksâ€™ performance as well as execution performance of the VBA scripts is presented here.

## Results


### Stock Performance

The table below compares the years of 2017 and 2018 for each stock in terms of Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return. The negative returns are highlighted in red, and the positive returns are highlighted in green. With this formatting, it is apparent from the table that the year of 2017 was a better year for green stocks than 2018. With such a drastic change from one year to the next, for the duration of this analysis, green stocks represent a risky investment. Further analysis since 2018 is necessary to determine the stability of green stock.

### Execution Performance

The first analysis of this data was executed utilizing a VBA script designed with nested loops. After creating header rows, an array for all the tickers, and setting the initial volume equal to zero, an outer loop was defined to cycle through the tickers identified for each stock and set up cells for the output data. Then an inner loop was created to mine each unique ticker determining the total volume and identifying the ending price and the starting price to calculate the yearly return. This code is pictured below.

</p>
The second analysis produced the same output, but the code was refactored to replace the nested loops with an index design. First a ticker index was defined, and three output arrays were created for the total volume, starting price, and ending price. Then these arrays were matched to the tickers by their ticker index. This eliminates the need for the outer loop.

## Summary


### Advantages of Refactoring

**Refactoring** refers to the process of restructuring computer code without changing its functionality [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring). The most obvious advantage of refactoring is by improving the structure to be more straightforward, it naturally makes it easier to work with. Consequently, bugs can be identified more readily and remedied. If the code is written in a design pattern, then it could be adapted to another project or easily extended to the current project to do deeper analyses. Moreover, if the code is written in an efficient manner, it could reduce the processing time. [Reference](https://anarsolutions.com/code-refactoring-concept-analysis/)

Regarding the analysis of this challenge, the advantage of refactoring reduced the processing time for each year significantly.

### Disadvantages of Refactoring

While refactoring can offer advantages, it also has a downside. Refactoring can be very time-consuming and could potentially introduce bugs into a script that was previously working. [Reference](https://anarsolutions.com/code-refactoring-concept-analysis/)

Regarding the analysis of this challenge, the processing times were reduced significantly, however the return investment on time involved to refactor the code was minimal. Perhaps if the data set were larger or more variables were being examined, the payoff would be more satisfying to the laborious act of refactoring.
